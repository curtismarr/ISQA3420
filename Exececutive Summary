Curtis Marr - Executive Summary

The purpose of this system has three parts. The overall goal is to ensure that any software pulled to be used in a company
has Licenses that work for the company, and is not too Vulnerable. It does this by allowing a Developer to submit a Software Package
to be scanned for any Vulnerabilities and Licenses Applied to it. The Manager and Developer are then able to view the results of a 
specific Software Package. The Manager sets certain Policies that are the guidelines that all of the Software Packages must fit into as
far as what Licenses are permissable and what Vulnerabilities are acceptable.
