Curtis Marr - Executive Summary

The purpose of this system has three parts. The overall goal is to ensure that any software pulled to be used in a company
has licenses that work for the company, and is not too vulnerable. It does this by allowing a Developer to submit a software package
to be scanned for any vulnerabilities and licenses applied to it. The Manager and Developer are then able to view the results of a 
specific software package. The Manager sets certain policies that are the guidelines that all of the software packages must fit into as
far as what licenses are permissable and what vulnerabilities are acceptable.

Open source software in corporations is widely used. From use of Linux for an operating system to imported packages to perform non-essential tasks. The use of open source software allows for companies to aquire software without developing it internally for free. Open source software has a community of users behind it to remove any bugs and improve functionality. By using open source software it allows for a company to save resources of time and money to accomplish a goal. While all of this sounds good and practical, some people don't think that the benefits outway the risks that having the source available to anyone could allow for malicious attacks, as well as licenses that the company would have to follow.
